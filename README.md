# Next.js Dashboard App — Learning Project

This repository contains a **learning project built while exploring Next.js** using the official tutorial  
[Next.js Learn — Dashboard App](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app).

The goal of this project was to get familiar with the **Next.js App Router**, server and client components, data fetching, authentication basics, and modern frontend tooling. It also served as my first hands-on experience with building a full-featured dashboard-style application in Next.js.
